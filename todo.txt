simulate by forwaring of NeurlNetwork
  make diabolo of eus model
  translate to COLLADA
  diaplay in RViz

apply LPF
  record stable diabolo pitch and yaw
  calc frequency
  (calc covariance)
  calc w0 of LPF
  apply LPF to log data
  plot and see whether LPF work well

make model
  x(t) = f(x(t-1), x(t-2), u(t-1)
  dx(t)/dt = f(x(t-1), x(t-2), u(t-1)  <- this is better?
  the way not to overfit

fit
  see accuracy
  
predict
  see accuracy

consider optimization of controller
  modify loss func
    x loss(pitch_diff, yaw_diff) = pitch_diff + yaw_diff
    o loss(pitch_diff, yaw_diff) = w1 * pitch_diff + w2 * yaw_diff
