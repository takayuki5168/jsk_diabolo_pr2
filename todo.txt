#PROBLEM
sometimes slow send input to PR2
  -> NO
  but sometimes arm, base stop and after that, move gakun

# CHECK
* is it ok to while spinOnce(acutually not use spinOnce), not spin in diabolo_system
    when spin is called

* check online training

# TODO
* toss with not set last velocity 0
    
(* test whether online training work well)
  is it best that delta is 0.01?

* predict some steps when realtime mpc

* in get_test(), get data from designated log file
    then see loss of each all log files one by one


* improve calc of pitch, yaw

* subscribe input in diabolo_system realtime feedback
* use clear_grads()



consider optimization of controller
  modify loss func
    x loss(pitch_diff, yaw_diff) = pitch_diff + yaw_diff
    o loss(pitch_diff, yaw_diff) = w1 * pitch_diff + w2 * yaw_diff




refactor
  whether everything work well after refactoring
what is latch

calc pitch more acculately
  not use one point, use some points when calculating pitch. at least 3 points each
  




consider model
  x(t) = f(x(t-1), x(t-2), u(t-1))
  dx(t)/dt = f(x(t-1), x(t-2), u(t-1)  <- this is better?
  the way not to overfit

add physical parameters
  train
  estimation

# DONE
apply LPF
  record stable diabolo pitch and yaw
  calc frequency
  (calc covariance)
  calc w0 or average_num of LPF
  apply LPF to log data
  plot and see whether LPF work well

fit
  see accuracy
  
predict
  see accuracy
